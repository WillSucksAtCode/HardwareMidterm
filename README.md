Initially, I wanted to use my initials side by side to create a controller, but I couldn't find a satisfying orientation for the user, so i decided to revise by stacking the initials on top of one another.
This ended up producing a gap in the middle of the controller, which created a fun visual design, as the controller looked like a monster mouth.
With a Wii U Gamepad controller as inspiration, I decided I would have the two sticks at the top of the controller, with the buttons underneath on in the dpad formation and one in the ABXY formation, as I find this to be a comfortable orientation.
I added a buzzer to the center of the controller as I think there could be a fun feedback with games.
I used 3 LEDS in the bottom middle section of the controller for Status, I believe they could be used for some nice user feedback, Power recieved, ON or Off, or even Power low if a battery could be used.
Overall, I wanted a design that would feel nice in the hand, so I ensured every surface was curved, avoiding any hard edges that could dig into the users hand.
